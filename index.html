<h2>Welcome to my Portfolio</h2>
<p>
  I am a Veteran of the United States Marine Corps.
</p>
<p>
  After leaving the Marine Corps I pursued automotive mechanics becoming an ASE Master Technician and a Toyota Expert Technician..
</p>
<p>
  As I have aged I have started to take my health and wellbeing much more seriously.</p>
<p>
  I am hoping that a career in technology provides a better work/life balance, more financial security, more upward mobility, and significantly slows my absorption of environmental toxins.
</p>
<p>
  I have picked the software realm to empower my pursuit of these goals because technology has entered every facet of our lives.  I feel that learning these skills will allow me to associate myself with nearly any organization on earth especially as the whole world has started to embrace remote work.
</p>
<p>
  As an automotive technician I am a experienced troubleshooter and have spent years strengthening my ability to diagnose problems down to their root cause.
</p>
<p>
  While I am still new to this path, I suspect that software development will eventually become a stepping stone for a path into Cyber Security.
